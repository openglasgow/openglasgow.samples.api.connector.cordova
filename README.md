# openglasgow.samples.api.connector.cordova
Windows Phone, Windows App, iOS and Android code samples to publish files to the Open Data Platform from a mobile app using Apache Cordova.

Add one of the following platforms we have tested with :

cordova platform add ios
cordova platform add android
cordova platform add windows

After this on Mac run :

cordova build ios
cordova build android

On Windows run:

cordova build windows
cordova build android

Then run the relevant output in an emulator. You can do this directly any platform as:

cordova emulate ios
cordova emulate android
cordova emulate windows

Finally click one of the four buttons in the launched app to create content on the platform.
